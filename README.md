# Spiral-Delight

This is a simple Match-3 game like Candy-Crush written in Unity C#
The only way the Spiral-Delight differs from Candy Crush is in the way the gems are arranged into the scene.
Instead of placing them in a rectangle and identifying matches along X and Y axis.

The gems are placed inside a circle and the matches are identified along the radius and circumference directions.
As a result, the gems dont form rows and columns like in the case of Candy-Crush, instead they form concentric rings on the board.
Instead of giving the freedom to swap an individual gem with another gem, Spiral-Delight offers only the freedom to rotate the rings,
meaning all the gems in a ring translate at the same pace at the same time.
